instruction: |
  When generating DOM elements (HTML or JSX/TSX), always create an `id` attribute whenever possible.
  - Prefer using `id` over `class` for uniquely identifying nodes.
  - Ensure `id` values are unique and meaningful.
  - When referring to elements in JavaScript or TypeScript (e.g. `document.getElementById`), use the `id` instead of query selectors where appropriate.
  - If an element is dynamically created, still generate a unique `id`.
  - Only omit `id` if there is a strong reason the element cannot or should not have one.
